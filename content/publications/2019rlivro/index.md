#abstract: In the present paper, an investigation regarding the transformations of studies published in the Brazilian Journal 
#of Public Administration (RAP) from 2003 to 2016 was conducted, through bibliometric research. The main results 
#indicate consolidation of the field, with an increase in the number of authors per article. Most authors were male, 
#although with a high participation of female researchers, in a context where most authors are Brazilian, from public 
#institutions. Case-studies, applied-approaches and quantitative methodology studies increased in comparison to 
#3studies published from 1994 to 2002.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
